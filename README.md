# ChallengeKit
This repository is a collection of my solutions and practice code to solve HackerRank's challenge kit. My objective of completing this challenge was to solidify my foundation of data structures and Java syntax. Each topic consisted of 3-6 coding challenges reviewing a common coding topic. The response to the coding challenges are in this repository.

In the source folder, you will see each day's work with the following files:

solution.java - This is my personal solution code that solves the challenge of the particular day.
other .java files - These files are typically code that were written along with the particular challenge.

In the data folder, you will see each day's supporting documents:
topicchallengeXX.pdf - This is a copy of the challenge description for reference.
